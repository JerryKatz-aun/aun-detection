---

**The First AI Mimicry Filter for Digital Credentials**  
A symbolic collapse filter that detects structural mimicry in cryptographic inputs like wallet addresses, API keys, certificates, and more.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
pip install aun-detection
```

```python
from aun_detection.operator import aun_filter

score = aun_filter("known_good_value", "suspect_value")

if score is None:
    print("🚨 Mimicry detected — credentials rejected.")
else:
    print(f"✅ Valid — dissimilarity score: {score:.4f}")
```

**Returns**
- `None`: mimicry detected (collapse threshold exceeded)
- `float`: dissimilarity score if credential passes

---

## 🔍 What It Does

AI can now generate credentials that *look* valid — near-perfect wallet, SSL, or API key spoofs.  
`aun-detection` collapses these mimics by analyzing structural logic rather than surface randomness.  
Use it for wallet validation, SSL integrity checks, API token screening, or CI/CD credential safety.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ∿ Symbolic filtering based on collapse logic  
- Detects AI-generated mimics of:
  - Wallet addresses  
  - SSL certificates  
  - API keys  
  - PKI credentials  
- Hamming + structural transform scoring  
- <3 ms detection runtime  
- Lightweight, explainable, no model training needed  

---

## 🤔 Why Symbolic Logic Instead of ML

- **Explainable:** every rejection has a deterministic mathematical cause  
- **Zero training data:** deploys instantly  
- **Fast:** <3 ms average runtime  
- **Deterministic:** identical input → identical output  

Unlike black-box models, ∿ filtering reveals how deception hides inside structure — not data.

---

## 🧠 Usage Example

```python
from aun_detection.operator import aun_filter

# Example: check for a spoofed wallet address
real_wallet = "bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh"
suspect_wallet = "bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wl1"  # final '1' vs 'h'

result = aun_filter(real_wallet, suspect_wallet)

if result is None:
    print("🚨 Mimicry detected — credentials rejected.")
else:
    print(f"✅ Inputs passed. Dissimilarity score: {result}")
```
